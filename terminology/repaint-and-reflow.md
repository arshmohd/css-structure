Each element creates a rectangle on the page. Sometimes that rectangle is visibly obvious and sometimes it's not. An demonstration of how this process looks in slow motion can be seen in this [reflow visualization video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTnIxIA5KGw).

The colorful boxes in the video are the elements being created and positioned on the page. This process is called reflow. It's normally a very fast process, but Mozilla has created these videos to demonstrate what reflow would look like if it were slowed down.
