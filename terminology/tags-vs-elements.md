title: "Tags vs Elements"
---

When we design a web page we use HTML tags. When those tags get rendered by the browser, they're no longer called tags; they're elements. Each HTML tag will turn into one element. Tags vs Elements is a subtle distinction for beginners but it will make a big difference later on. Think of it this way; Each tag you write in HTML is an instruction for the browser to make something. When the browser reads the HTML instructions and draws rectangles on the page, those rectangles are the elements which came from your tags. So when we're discussing a rendered page, we would say we have elements, not tags.
