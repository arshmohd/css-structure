## Preface

Besides making sites look pretty, CSS is also responsible for establishing site layout. In other words, the placement of the main sections on the site is accomplished through CSS Layout. So then what is the difference between CSS Layout and CSS Structure? This website will make a distinction between the two terms:

> **CSS Layout** describes the site's main sections and how they relate to each other.

> **CSS Structure** describes the techniques and patterns we use to accomplish anything that is spacial in CSS from small components to our larger layout.

Other CSS professionals might use the terms interchangeably or with different meaning. For instance, what this site calls "layout" is sometimes also referred to as CSS Scaffolding.
